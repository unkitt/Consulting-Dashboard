# Project Insights and Analytical Report from a Consulting Startup

At a restaurant consulting startup, I independently designed and developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard from scratch to monitor and analyze restaurant performance. Leveraging over 30,000 rows of historical data, I tracked key business metrics across 70+ kitchens and 240+ outlets. On a weekly basis, I conducted in-depth analyses to evaluate growth trends, identify underperforming areas, and provide actionable recommendations. My insights directly contributed to strategic decisions aimed at improving outlet operations and driving consistent growth.
